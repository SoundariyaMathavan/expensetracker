# Fixed Version Instructions

There was a syntax error in the original `app.py` file. Follow these instructions to use the fixed version.

## Running the Fixed Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the fixed version of the app:
   ```
   python app_fixed.py
   ```
   
   Or use the batch file:
   ```
   run_fixed.bat
   ```

3. The server will start on http://localhost:5000

## Running the Frontend

1. In a separate terminal, start the React frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Testing the API

You can test the API directly using the provided batch file:

```
test_api.bat
```

This will make requests to all the API endpoints and display the responses.

## Verifying the Fix

1. Open the dashboard in your browser
2. Select different categories from the dropdown
3. Verify that all parts of the dashboard update:
   - The statistics (Total Spending, Daily Average, Max Weekly)
   - The charts (Spending Analysis, Trend Over Time)
   - The recommendations

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console output from both the backend and frontend servers
2. Look at the browser's developer console for error messages
3. Use the debug section at the bottom of the dashboard to see the current filters
4. Try clicking the "Refresh Data" button in the debug section

## What Was Fixed

1. Fixed syntax errors in the backend code
2. Corrected the category filtering logic
3. Ensured all visualizations update when changing categories
4. Added debugging tools to help diagnose issues
